# MTool Manual Trans Script

Accroding to the author, it's allowed to translate and share *ManualTransFile.json* freely given that not been processed by mtool itself.

This script doesn't come with translator api in it. You must offer a function for `process` or `process_file`.

This script changes *ManualTransFile.json*. If key != value, it's considered as traslated.

Later, rename *ManualTransFile.json* to *TrsData.json*.
